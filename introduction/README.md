# Thomas Edison’s 1885 Diary 

Edison spent much of June and July 1885 in Boston and environs in the company of long-time friend ==Ezra Gilliland=={description="Electrical manufacturer and inventor Ezra Torrance Gilliland (1848– 1903) was a former telegraph associate and business partner with Edison, most recently in promoting the phonograph in 1878. Gilliland had recently been a telephone office manager in Indianapolis, but at this time he superintended the mechanical department of the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston."} and his wife ==Lillian=={description="Lillian Gilliland, the daughter of Sidney Johnson, a carpenter and machinist of Madison, Ind., became Ezra Gilliland’s secondwife in 1880. According to Edison’s daughter Marion, she played a central role in introducing Edison to eligible young women.Two of them were Daisy Gaston and Louise Igoe, both of Indianapolis."}.  Much of that time was spent at ==No. 3 Woodside Park=={description="Samuel Insull addressed Edison at this address in a letter of 20 July 1885. No. 3 was probably the middle of the five cottages built in 1885 at Woodside Park. The one at the top of the park, which was the subject of a cultural resource report in 1994, may be the best preserved example of the 1885 design."}, the Gillilands rented cottage in Winthrop, on the shore of Boston Harbor. No. 3 was likely the middle of the five cottages built in 1885 at Woodside Park. The one at the top of the park, now No. 4 Woodside, was the subject of a cultural resource report in 1994 and is the best preserved example of the 1885 design.

## First Visit to Woodside Villa

It is unclear when Edison’s first visit to Woodside Villa (as he called it in his diary) took place. He and Gilliland were working together at Gilliland’s office in the American Bell Telephone Co.’s headquarters at 95 Milk St. in Boston in late May and early in June but likely spent some time in Winthrop. After returning to New York on ==9 June=={description="Edison was with Ezra Gilliland in Boston early in June, perhaps for as long as a week, before he was back in New York on 9 June, and the two men may have spent some time in Winthrop."}. he traveled back to Boston on June 18 and probably spent most of his time in Winthrop until he returned to New York at the end of the first week of July.  On July 13, Edison began an overnight journey, accompanied by his daughter ==Marion=={description="Marion Estelle Edison (1873-1965) was Edison's oldest child with his first wife Mary. Nicknamed 'Dot,' she was Edison's constant companion until he married Mina Miller in February 1886. After attending the Bradford Academy in Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1888, she left school to join her step-aunts Mary Emily Miller and Grace Miller in Paris. She came back to the United States in 1892 but returned to Europe the following year. She married Oscar Oeser, a German army officer, on 1 October 1895 and lived in Germany for the next thirty years until the marriage deteriorate during World War I. She returned to the United States in 1925."}, back to Boston and Winthrop, where he spent the week of 14–21 July.  

## Returning to Winthrop

During this last visit, Edison and others in the party each kept a diary to be shared for their mutual entertainment. Edison's diary is the only known volume that he kept specifically to record thoughts and feelings of a personal nature.  It begins with events on 12 July, when he was still at Menlo Park, and continues with an account of his travels on 13–14 July from New York City through Long Island Sound on an overnight boat to Providence, Rhode Island, where they took a train to Boston. Edison composed these early entries retrospectively as he recorded his purchase of the diary books and pencils in Boston in his entry of July 15. Thereafter, the journal continues with accounts of the week's recreations, which included sailing, listening to music, and reading aloud.  Edison incorporated observations on literature, art, and religion, along with comments about his dreams, his health, and the weather.  

## Looking for a Wife

The diary may also be read as a courtship document. Edison's first wife, ==Mary=={description="Mary Stilwell Edison (1855-1884), sometimes referred to as 'Mame,' was Edison's first wife. The daughter of Nicholas Stilwell, a Newark sawyer, and his second wife Margaret Crane, she met TAE while working for his News Reporting Telegraph Co. They were married on Christmas Day 1871 and had three children: Marion Estelle (Oeser), Thomas Alva, Jr., and William Leslie. She died at Menlo Park on 9 August 1884 and was buried in Mt. Pleasant Cemetery in Newark. Her death certificate states that she died of "congestion of the brain" but there is circumstantial evidence that she may have died of an accidental overdose of medicinal morphine used to treat pain."}, had died in August 1884. His daughter Marion later recalled that it was while traveling with the Gillilands to New Orleans and Florida in February and March 1885 that her father concluded "he wanted a home, a wife and a mother for his three children and asked Mrs. Gilliland, who lived in Boston, to introduce him to some suitable girls." The Gillilands seem to have arranged Edison's stay at Winthrop in order to introduce him to marriageable women of appropriate background.  Mrs. Gilliland ==invited=={description="Mina apparently was invited to Winthrop sometime after Louise Igoe and Daisy Gaston. Those two longtime Indianapolis friends of the Gillilands knew their intentions by mid- April; Mina, six or seven years younger and a more recent acquaintance, made her plans a month later."} two—==Grace "Daisy" Gaston=={description="Grace 'Daisy' Gaston (1859– 1940), daughter of John M. Gaston, a prominent Indianapolis physician, was Ezra and Lillian Gilliland’s guest at their rented summer home during Edison’s earlier visit from late June to early July. She was still there, perhaps according to a plan to introduce Edison to eligible young women, when he returned on July 14."} and ==Louise M. Igoe=={description="Louise M. Igoe (1858?– 1936) of Indianapolis was visiting Boston as a guest of Lillian Gilliland. A friend of Mina Miller’s older sister Jane, Louise introduced Mina to the Gillilands. She later married Mina’s older brother Robert Anderson Miller. Her brother Philip married Lillie Fox, Lillian Gilliland’s friend, in 1886."}—from her hometown of Indianapolis and another—==Mina Miller=={Q22087338}, of more recent acquaintance—from Akron, Ohio.  Edison used the diary to signal—clearly but gently—to the Gillilands and the other young women his preference for Miss Miller, who would become his second wife in February 1886. 

## The Courtship

Precisely when Edison and Mina were introduced has been a matter of dispute.  Newspapers at the time of their marriage made conflicting claims, which historians and biographers have sometimes used to reconstruct the story of their ==courtship=={description="Two of the more persistent stories are that they met either at the World's Industrial and Cotton Exhibition at New Orleans in late February or early March 1885, or at the Miller family's summer house in Chautauqua, New York, during the ensuing summer. These reports are erroneous, however. Mina's account book for 1885 shows that she did not travel to New Orleans in the late winter but remained in Boston, and Edison does not appear to have been in Chautauqua until August, well after he wrote of her in his diary."}. Mina herself, in a 1947 interview with Associated Press reporter Milton Marmor, said that she first met Edison at a "friend's" Boston apartment during a dinner party. "I was taking music at the time," Mina noted. "I never played for anybody but they asked me to play, and so I said, 'Oh, well, I'll never see these people again.' That was the first time we knew each other." She found Edison to be, on the basis of this first encounter, "a genial, lovely man."  Marmor then asked, "Do you remember after you first met Mr. Edison at the dinner in Boston whether anything developed that night? Did the romance develop then? To this, Mina replied somewhat ambiguously: 


> No, I thought I would never see him again. Oh yes, then Mrs. Gilliland (that was just the close of the year of the term and they were going up to the beach home) and they wanted me to go for a week and so I wrote and asked father if I could go for a week and while I was there Mr. Edison came up.  
> 
> "I don't think that was an accident," Marmor observed. To which Mina responded, "I guess it was. Anyway, we enjoyed it there. I was there a week and he went there once in awhile." 

It is clear from Mina's account, which must be reckoned the most definitive, that she and Edison were introduced at the Gillilands' Boston apartment in the Hotel Huntington, 101 Milk Street, though the time of the meeting remains uncertain.  They could have met one Sunday in late January when they both were in Boston, though it is also possible that they met some other time in the winter or spring. It is unclear if they met when Edison was in Boston or Winthrop from the end of May through early June but they likely had occasion to deepen their acquaintance after Edison returned to Winthrop in mid-June.  The Boston Daily Globe noted on 28 June that Edison and Daisy Gaston were staying with the Gillilands at Winthrop, and his correspondence shows that he did not return to New York until 7 or 8 July.  For her part, Mina attended the Yale commencement on 25 June and the Yale-Harvard Boat Race in New London, Connecticut, the next day but was in Winthrop before 1 July.  She seems to have stayed with the Gillilands after Edison departed for New York.  However, she left Winthrop before Edison returned on the fourteenth. Although his acquaintance with Mina at Winthrop was brief, it was long enough for her to have made an indelible impression on the young widower, who soon after publicly signaled his affection toward her as "the Maid of Chataqua."
